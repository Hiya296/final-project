## 📖 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive automated testing project built with Python, Selenium, and Allure Reports. 
The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for a modular and maintainable test suite.

>> (Don't forget to explore the DevTools 😉)
>> 
> **Create scenarios for tests**
>> What I wish to test and how to do it
>> 
> **Search for anything that might cause failure**
>> Don't forget to insert it to the tests
>> 
> **Use any assist you can**
>> It's not shame to ask for help and use any tool for more knowledge.
